## Common Patterns

### Grade All Pending Submissions for an Assignment

```python
import json
import os
import urllib.request

BASE = os.environ["GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_API_URL"]
COURSE = "course_001"
COURSEWORK = "cw_108"

def api_get(path):
    with urllib.request.urlopen(f"{BASE}{path}") as r:
        return json.loads(r.read())

def api_patch(path, data):
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"{BASE}{path}",
        data=json.dumps(data).encode(),
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        method="PATCH"
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        return json.loads(r.read())

def api_post(path):
    req = urllib.request.Request(f"{BASE}{path}", data=b"", method="POST")
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        return json.loads(r.read())

subs = api_get(f"/v1/courses/{COURSE}/courseWork/{COURSEWORK}/studentSubmissions?states=TURNED_IN")
for sub in subs.get("studentSubmissions", []):
    sid = sub["id"]
    grade = 42  # your grading logic here
    api_patch(f"/v1/courses/{COURSE}/courseWork/{COURSEWORK}/studentSubmissions/{sid}", {"assignedGrade": grade, "draftGrade": grade})
    api_post(f"/v1/courses/{COURSE}/courseWork/{COURSEWORK}/studentSubmissions/{sid}:return")
    print(f"Graded and returned {sid} with score {grade}")
```

### Check for Late Submissions Across All Assignments

```python
courses = api_get("/v1/courses?courseStates=ACTIVE")
for course in courses.get("courses", []):
    cid = course["id"]
    cw_list = api_get(f"/v1/courses/{cid}/courseWork?pageSize=100")
    for cw in cw_list.get("courseWork", []):
        subs = api_get(f"/v1/courses/{cid}/courseWork/{cw['id']}/studentSubmissions?late=true")
        for sub in subs.get("studentSubmissions", []):
            print(f"Late: {sub['userId']} in {course['name']} / {cw['title']}")
```

### Generate a Grading Summary Report

```python
COURSE = "course_001"
cw_list = api_get(f"/v1/courses/{COURSE}/courseWork?pageSize=100")
for cw in cw_list.get("courseWork", []):
    subs = api_get(f"/v1/courses/{COURSE}/courseWork/{cw['id']}/studentSubmissions?pageSize=100")
    all_subs = subs.get("studentSubmissions", [])
    graded = [s for s in all_subs if s.get("assignedGrade") is not None]
    turned_in = [s for s in all_subs if s["state"] == "TURNED_IN"]
    if graded:
        avg = sum(s["assignedGrade"] for s in graded) / len(graded)
        print(f"{cw['title']}: {len(graded)} graded (avg {avg:.1f}/{cw['maxPoints']}), {len(turned_in)} awaiting grading")
    else:
        print(f"{cw['title']}: {len(turned_in)} submissions awaiting grading, none graded yet")
```
