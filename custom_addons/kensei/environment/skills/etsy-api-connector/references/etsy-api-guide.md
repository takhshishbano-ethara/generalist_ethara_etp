## Common Patterns

### Find and Ship Unshipped Paid Orders

```python
import json
import os
import urllib.request

BASE = os.environ["ETSY_API_URL"]
SHOP_ID = "29457183"

def api_get(path, params=None):
    url = f"{BASE}{path}"
    if params:
        url += "?" + "&".join(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in params.items())
    with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as r:
        return json.loads(r.read())

def api_put(path, data):
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        f"{BASE}{path}",
        data=json.dumps(data).encode(),
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        method="PUT"
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        return json.loads(r.read())

# Find paid but unshipped receipts
receipts = api_get(f"/v3/application/shops/{SHOP_ID}/receipts", {"status": "paid", "was_shipped": "false"})
for receipt in receipts.get("results", []):
    receipt_id = receipt["receipt_id"]
    print(f"Order {receipt_id} for {receipt['name']} needs shipping")
```

### Check for Low-Rating Reviews

```python
reviews = api_get(f"/v3/application/shops/{SHOP_ID}/reviews")
for review in reviews.get("results", []):
    if review["rating"] <= 3:
        print(f"⚠ Low review ({review['rating']}★) on listing {review['listing_id']}: {review['review'][:80]}...")
```

### Audit Listing Inventory

```python
listings = api_get(f"/v3/application/shops/{SHOP_ID}/listings")
for listing in listings.get("results", []):
    if listing["quantity"] <= 2:
        print(f"Low stock: {listing['title']} — only {listing['quantity']} remaining (${listing['price']})")
```
