# MyFitnessPal API Guide

Detailed patterns and examples for working with the MyFitnessPal nutrition tracking API.

## Base URL

Set via the `MYFITNESSPAL_API_URL` environment variable (e.g. `http://myfitnesspal-api:8006`).

# Update profile
curl -X PUT "$MYFITNESSPAL_API_URL/v1/user/profile" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"activity_level": "very_active", "daily_calorie_goal": 2000}'
```

## Goals

```bash
# Get nutrition goals
curl "$MYFITNESSPAL_API_URL/v1/user/goals"

# Update goals (calorie target and macros)
curl -X PUT "$MYFITNESSPAL_API_URL/v1/user/goals" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"daily_calorie_goal": 1900, "macro_goals": {"protein_pct": 40, "carbs_pct": 35, "fat_pct": 25}}'
```

## Food Database

## Common Patterns

### Check Daily Progress Against Goals

```python
import json
import os
import urllib.request

BASE = os.environ["MYFITNESSPAL_API_URL"]

def api_get(path):
    with urllib.request.urlopen(f"{BASE}{path}") as r:
        return json.loads(r.read())

totals = api_get("/v1/user/nutrition/2025-04-28")
remaining = totals["remaining"]
consumed = totals["totals"]
goal = totals["goal"]

print(f"Calories: {consumed['calories']:.0f} / {goal['calories']} ({remaining['calories']:.0f} remaining)")
print(f"Protein:  {consumed['protein_g']:.1f}g / {goal['protein_g']}g")
if remaining["calories"] < 200:
    print("Warning: Very close to calorie limit!")
```

### Find High-Protein Foods for Remaining Budget

```python
foods = api_get("/v1/foods/search")
totals = api_get("/v1/user/nutrition/2025-04-28")
cals_left = totals["remaining"]["calories"]

suggestions = []
for food in foods["results"]:
    if food["calories"] <= cals_left and food["protein_g"] >= 20:
        suggestions.append(food)

suggestions.sort(key=lambda f: f["protein_g"], reverse=True)
for s in suggestions[:5]:
    print(f"{s['food_name']}: {s['calories']} cal, {s['protein_g']}g protein")
```

### Weekly Exercise and Weight Summary

```python
exercises = api_get("/v1/user/exercises?start_date=2025-04-22&end_date=2025-04-28")
weight_log = api_get("/v1/user/weight")

total_burned = sum(e["calories_burned"] for e in exercises["results"])
total_minutes = sum(e["duration_minutes"] for e in exercises["results"])
print(f"This week: {exercises['count']} workouts, {total_minutes} min, {total_burned} cal burned")

entries = weight_log["results"]
if len(entries) >= 2:
    latest = entries[0]["weight_lbs"]
    oldest = entries[-1]["weight_lbs"]
    print(f"Weight trend: {oldest} -> {latest} lbs ({latest - oldest:+.1f})")
```
